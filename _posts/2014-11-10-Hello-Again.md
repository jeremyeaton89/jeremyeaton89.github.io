# A Rekindled Coding Practice 


Well, I must say, it is a joy to read through blog posts of past. It’s not every day you dive into the former mentality of self as one typically focuses on progress moving forward, but to look back speaks truth to the fact that, yes, you are indeed evolving.

I always wonder what I was thinking, or how it felt to be alive moments prior to the turn of a new chapter, but it seems writing can take you there. As life presents its latest challenge, often looking back can be a source of encouragement.

Oh how I’ve grown in the last year with The Hunt. I feel dense with knowledge, and calm with flow, and yet there is so much farther to go. I used to long for more freedom, but I am truly happy where I am. I feel the path unfold, and I look forward to what each new day may hold.
