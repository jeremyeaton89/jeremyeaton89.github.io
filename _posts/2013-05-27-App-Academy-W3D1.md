# SQL for Days

Today, we dove into SQL. SQL is a powerful language used to query relational databases. I had basic knowledge of SQL prior to App Academy, but in one day I blew that knowledge out of the water. We hopped onto SQLZoo and ran through tutorials for the day, where we were subquerying, joining tables, and aliasing to our hearts’ content. Tomorrow we will step deeper into SQL and use it with Ruby. Eventually, we’ll start using Active Record, which spurns tables and columns into Ruby objects, ripe for-a-manipulatin’. I take it we’re doing things the “hard way” first, learning what lay beneath the layer of abstraction that is Active Record.

I really want to excel with SQL - I think it builds a solid foundation into Rails. And on that note, I must go! There’s a readin’ to be done.
