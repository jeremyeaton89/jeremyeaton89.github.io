# HTML5. Me likey

I've been tinkering with HTML5/Cordova/ReactJS so much lately that I've decided to consolidate my thoughts about them into one post. So, what's up?

I personally love the combination. ReactJS is simple, intuitive, and performant. Cordova brings native api power to an otherwise normal, not to say exceedingly sophisiticated, JS/CSS web app. And HTML5 as a platform brings portability in a truly one codebase - many platforms (or devices) solution. I'm pretty excited about developing some 2D games, too, where they can be played on mobile, desktop, and even gaming consoles. But, as a mobile app developer, I need to set realistic expectations.

HTML5 is not iOS. HTML5 is not Android. HTML5 is HTML5, and one must code to its inherent strengths and weaknesses. If someone approaches me expecting iOS native-like dazzling animations, or bleeding edge features fresh out of the latest version of iOS, he or she will be disappointed. But if you know your target platform's native code, some of that can be arranged (painfully). 

In truth, a Corodva/PhoneGap app can do almost everything a native born app can, it just takes more work. Animations must be carefully orchestrated so as not to incur too much redraw, or (God forbid) reflow. True, some animations must be avoided, but if technological ability really doubles every 2 years, well.. we'll get there :). The same tricks used to create a responsive experience typically (pre-fetching, lazy loading, etc.) can be used, and where native has built in, resusable table cells, for e.g., well... we'll have to tossle the HTML5 way - it can be done. On occasion, I have spent much time optimizing something for HTML5 that is silky smooth for native iOS, fresh out of the box, but these are the pains we must deal with to move this platform forward! 

Probably most of the time, it will make sense to choose native Android and native iOS vs HTML5 supported on both platforms, but for tiny teams or solo artists, HTML5 is truly powerful. You may not win sexiest app of the year, but you will get the job done, reaching so many people around the world, on all platforms, and that is hugely powerful. I, among others, will continue to improve this platform, sometimes gritting my teeth in the process; but with an open mind, an elegant solution can be found. You do you, HTML5.
