# Test Early, Commit Often

Today we had our first solo day! Couple things i learned: test early and often, and commit often! I spent 45 minutes trying to debug a silly mistake where i left old code present, and this confused me. Once I overcame this, solo work went smoothly. Right off the bat, i noticed that others were already ahead of me, which got me feeling a bit nervous, but in the end, I was able to finish with few hiccups, and quicker than I had imagined. I have found that i tend to be meditative in my approach. At first, i started writing pieces of code, but I quickly found that it didn’t fit intuitively with my code base as a whole. It was only when i took a slower, more gradual approach, where I sort of “felt” my way through, did things come together, and they came together well! Not once did I feel lost - a stark contrast to pair programming. I guess this means that I need to get better at reading other people’s code and understanding other people’s approaches to problems. 

Another thing I enjoyed about solo programming was this feeling of freedom - I felt more free to explore, and because of this, I was able to discover more elegant solutions. When I’m paired, I may have ideas, but i don’t feel confident because I’m still learning, and if a partner’s idea sounds fair, I immediately agree. Anyhoo, I’m enjoying my experience so far.
