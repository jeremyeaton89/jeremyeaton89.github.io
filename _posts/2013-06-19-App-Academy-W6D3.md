# jQuery Magic
Today we dove into the fantastic jQuery library. With this library, we can perform powerful tasks on DOM objects with ease. Each browser handles things a tad differently from one another, but fortunately, jQuery’s got our backs. Apparently, the library is something like 10,000 lines long, but I blame it on IE (FU MS). Anyways, jQuery essentially takes DOM objects and wraps them up in jQuery - this gives us access to sweet methods that make, adding, removing, moving, and manipulating DOM objects pretty easy. We can use CSS selectors to grab whatever element(s) we need with relative ease, and work our magic.

We were tasked with building the UI portions of our Tic Tac Toe and Towers of Hanoi projects. Nailed it! lol, well, our games work, but they could use some visual sprucing. But i’ll save beautification for my final project. 

Cheers.
