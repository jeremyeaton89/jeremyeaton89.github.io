# Ajaxification
Today was an interesting day. We started off with a lecture, watching Ned build the project that we had been assigned to complete on Friday. It was very helpful to watch a seasoned veteran think through an application, because my code often falls into slight discord on my first go at a new concept/technology. 

We got to witness the use of $.ajax, which is a jQuery method used to make Ajax requests. I’ve found it beneficial to understand the nuts and bolts of something before using a technology that abstracts away much of these details. In previous cases, writing out our own forms vs using forms helpers gave us power over form development, and I think using $.ajax vs “remote true” (magical way of asking forms to execute Ajax requests) will give us power over this technology in much the same way. 

Today was different in that we spend the majority of the day in lecture. While i found this very helpful, I’m glad to know that this will continue to be a rarity, as diving in and working things out with a pair programmer can be a more powerful and enriching experience.
