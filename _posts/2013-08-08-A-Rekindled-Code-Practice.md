# A Rekindled Coding Practice 

Its 2 am and I've had yet another one of those epic late night excursions through the world of code. This time, I ventured to discover the simplistic power of Jekyll, a light weight, blog-aware, static site generator. I'm excited to have a hackerific blog tonight as I debut the reopening of my technical writing practice. Its been a solid 3 weeks since the end of App Academy, and no, the learning never stops :)

These are some interesting times ahead. I'm occasionally overrun with this longwinded sense of freedom - it lasts for stints much as it has tonight. Occassionally, I do feel a sense of urgency: apply, apply, apply! I'm beginning to find a balance between moving forward with my job search and exploring the world of code on my own volition, letting my deeper longings lead me to new places, casting worries of job marketability aside for a time.

My exploration of Jekyll was fruitful. I have Andrew Munsell to thank for an [awesome tutorial](http://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/ultimate-jekyll-tutorial/). I love how simple it is, and how easily I can deploy a site via github (Jekyll powers Github Pages). I think the most powerful feature of this engine is the ability to add blog posts. All you do is make a _posts file at the root of your directory, follow a particular naming convention for your markdown or textile post file, add some YAML front-matter, and viola! To render posts to the page, you simply grab them with the `site.posts` property and iterate. There's built in pagination too, and much more (but trust me, its pretty simple). And did I mention its written in Ruby?! Well, I'm off to bed now, but once I get up, I'll be sure to finish up my site.

'Til next time.
