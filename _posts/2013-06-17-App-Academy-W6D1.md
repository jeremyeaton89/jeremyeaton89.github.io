# Quirky JS

Well, yes, Javascript is indeed a quirky language. It has a few things that make it pretty different from Ruby (other than obvious syntactical differences). Unlike Ruby, blocks in Javascript do not delineate a new scope. Only functions have the power to do this. A closures is another Javascript nuance - these are functions that enclose upon variables outside of their scope. 

Javascript is primarily used to communicate with the DOM, but recently, Javascript has been used on the server side (Node.js). Node has been our first introduction to JS, but it will be short lived. We will soon move into using javascript in a browser, with forms and AJAX to boot.
