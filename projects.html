<h3>Active Record Lite</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/jeremyeaton89/ActiveRecordLite"><h5>Code</h5></a>

<p>Active Record Lite is a simpler version of Active Record, the ORM behind Ruby on Rails. This was my first experience with metaprogramming, where I am able to establish associations (belongs_to, has_many, has_one_through) and dynamically create methods on those associated objects.</p>
