      <p>Eat or Not is my answer to the question: can HTML5 mobile apps (using Cordova and ReactJS) provide a decent user experience.</p>

      <p>I was determined to see if HTML5 could provide an experience that made you feel pretty good. That means using page transitions and simple animations while also being responsive/performant. What has become clear is that old phones cannot handle these fancier features, but newer phones absolutely can, which warms me up about the future of HTML mobile app development :)</p>

      <p>You can download a demo of the app for iOS <a href="https://hosthelper.herokuapp.com/builds/9C2RRKhsZLjXs1rPLw1dOQ">here</a> and Android <a href="https://hosthelper.herokuapp.com/builds/lwOyzSCB-szP_2D4IDUaiA">here</a>.</p> 
      
      <p>Take note of the page transitions, searchbar animation, and horizontally swipeable lists on the profile view</p>

      <h3>Party Print</h3>
      <ul class='tags'>
        <li>Cordova</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <li>Infinite Scrolling</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is an app a friend asked me to make for corporate events. A company can drive attendees to tag their Instagram photos with their hashtag whereby using this app, attendees can find their photos and print them in a fashion similar to that of a photobooth.</p>

      <p>The concept is pretty simple, and the prototype did not take long to make; however, getting an HTML5 app to scroll infinitely with hundreds or thousands of images was no trivial task. I basically had to pull every trick outta the book: setting overflowed images to invisible, swapping images for small 'dummy' images, periodically deleting pages of old images, caching to preserve the feed when navigating to another page. It's challenges like these that really make mobile HTML5 development feel more difficult than native, but HTML5 certainly has its place.</p>

      <p>The app is not yet live, but you can still <a href="https://github.com/jeremyeaton89/Party-Print">view the code</a>.</p>

      <p>This is a simple tool that I use to host demo builds, be they for iOS or Android. It's based off of a tool I used during my stint at The Hunt.</p>

      <p>SoundStorm is a clone of SoundCloud.com and my capstone project for App Academy. This was my first attempt at creating a moderately sized single page app, using nearly 100% Ruby on Rails JSON API and BackboneJS. I spent a lot of time massaging css into the arfully crafted audio player, available for demonstration.</p>
