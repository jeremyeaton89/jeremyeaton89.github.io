# About Me

2 years ago, I began as a Quality Assurance Engineer at [Avant, LLC](http://avantexperience.com) where I took ownership of [MyBrainSolutions.com](https://www.mybrainsolutions.com) with respect to testing and documentation.

During that time, I coded on the side using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Late 2012, I took a serious study of **Ruby** and the **Ruby on Rails** framework, and later joined [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum). I am now graduated and looking to join a development team full time.
