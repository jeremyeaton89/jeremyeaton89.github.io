          <h1>Ajaxification</h1>

<p>Today was an interesting day. We started off with a lecture, watching Ned build the project that we had been assigned to complete on Friday. It was very helpful to watch a seasoned veteran think through an application, because my code often falls into slight discord on my first go at a new concept/technology.</p>

<p>We got to witness the use of $.ajax, which is a jQuery method used to make Ajax requests. I’ve found it beneficial to understand the nuts and bolts of something before using a technology that abstracts away much of these details. In previous cases, writing out our own forms vs using forms helpers gave us power over form development, and I think using $.ajax vs “remote true” (magical way of asking forms to execute Ajax requests) will give us power over this technology in much the same way.</p>

<p>Today was different in that we spend the majority of the day in lecture. While i found this very helpful, I’m glad to know that this will continue to be a rarity, as diving in and working things out with a pair programmer can be a more powerful and enriching experience.</p>
